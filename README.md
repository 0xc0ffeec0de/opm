A `apt`-like systems package manager written in Rust for many operating systems packages.
(See [supported-packages](#supported-packages)).
It provides either a higher level interface and a low-level one for those who want to build and inspect the packages.
This package manager aims to be universal/generic and simple. 

It's always good to remember that `IT IS NOT A WRAPPER`
for known package managers(apt, aptitude, dnf, yum, etc) neither a front-end for others (dpkg, rpm, etc).

**Note**: Most of the features and functionalities aren't done and/or stable yet. We're working to release a full working and stable version that can run on any operation system, including Microsoft Windows. For now just for debian-based linux distributions.

## Installation
**NOTE:** Since OPM is not stable yet, it's not recommended to use it on your OS directly

### From releases:

You can find a binary release for you architecture in the [releases](https://github.com/0xc0ffeec0de/opm/releases) tab.
