# OPM (Oxidized Package Manager)

A `apt`-like system's package manager written in Rust for many operation systems distributions packages 
(See [supported-packages](#supported-packages). For more details check [supported-package-features](#supported-package-features)).
It provides either a higher level interface and a low-level one for those who want to build and inspect the packages.
This package manager aims to be universal/generic and simple. 

It's always good to remember that `IT IS NOT A WRAPPER`
for known package managers(apt, aptitude, dnf, yum, etc) neither a front-end for others (dpkg, rpm, etc).

**Note**: Most of the features and functionalities aren't done and/or stable yet. We're working to release a full working and stable version that can run on any operation system, including Microsoft Windows. For now just for debian-based linux distributions.

## Installation
### From releases (not-recommended):

You can find a binary release for you architecture in the [releases](https://github.com/0xc0ffeec0de/opm/releases) tab.

### From source:

You'll need to have [rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your machine
```
$ git clone git@github.com:0xc0ffeec0de/opm.git
$ cd opm/
```
If you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed you can run `docker build -t opm .` to run it inside a container.

**NOTE**: You need to define a environment variable called `PKG_FMT` to define on which package format `opm` will be working with. For now just `deb` is supported.
