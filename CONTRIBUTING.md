## Bug reporting
See the [SECUTIRY.md](SECURITY.md) for more information.
 
## New features
  You got an idea of a good feature that would be good in `opm`. We appreciate it ^-^.
  Now you have two ways of see that new feature in the project:
  1. Sending a PR
  2. Open an Issue
  
  **Note:** Both should be tagged with `suggestion`.
  
  Then we'll analize and see if it's possible to implement that feature you suggest.
 
## Code improvement
  When you was looking through the code you thought _"I can do this better"_. We dont mind, go ahead an create a PR (should be tagged with `code-improvement`).
  Just make sure it'll not break anything. Just keep in mind that here we follow the [`KISS principle`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle),
  so we'll probably merge your PR, unless it adds much more code complexity/boilerplate (even though it gains more performance).
