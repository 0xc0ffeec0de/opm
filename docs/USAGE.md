## Basic Usage
This all involves the high-level API

### Package Installation
You can search and install by the name
```
$ opm install <package_name>
```
Or if you have a package file (e.g.: `.deb`) you can give the path to it as an argument and then the package will be installed
```
$ opm install /path/to/the/<package_name>.deb
```

### Package Removing
A package can be removed only by the name it was installed before
```
$ opm remove <package_name>
```

### Package Search
You can use a regex to search for a package
```
$ opm search <expression>
```
E.g.: `$ opm search "^lib.*name"`

### Package Listing
All installed packages can be listed by using the `--list/-l` option
```
$ opm --list
```
Or
```
$ opm -l
```

## Advanced Usage
This all involves the low-level API
None are ready, it's just for "preview"

### Package Building
To build a package you need to have the `fmt` defined on the config file.

You can build a package through the `--build` option. It'll build a package following the defined on the `fmt` field of the `config.json` file.

As input you pass the directory where the files are. Make sure that your following the instructions on how to build thet package you want.
```
$ opm build --build <mypackage>/
```

### Package Inspecting
You want to have a look at a package before installing? Use the `--inspect` on the `.deb` package. It'll bring informations about the package.
```
$ opm --inspect <package_name>.deb
```
