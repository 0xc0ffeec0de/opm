# Security Policy

## Security bugs reporting
 
 If you found a security bug, report it to our contact email `0xc0ffeec0de@protonmail.com`. After we've fixed the bug, you can open the issue describing the bug, how to reproduce and then we'll close it.
 This way it can be on the closed tab and be a public knwon fixed bug. Also you'll get the credits UwU, so everybody wins.
