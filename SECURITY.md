# Security Policy

## Bug reporting
 Before reporting check if it was already reported on the [issues tab](https://github.com/0xc0ffeec0de/opm/issues).
 If you got faced by a bug, you can open an issue describing the problem. When reporting it's always good to give some context, like when, where and what was expected then.
 So things like what was you expecting to get, your operation system and version, rustc, toolchain and cargo version, if got some unexpected `panic!` enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` environment variable.
 Basically the more info you gave the better.
 
 If you found a security bug, report it to our contact email `0xc0ffeec0de@protonmail.com`. After we've fixed the bug, you can open the issue describing the bug, how to reproduce and then we'll close it.
 This way it can be on the closed tab and be a public knwon fixed bug. Also you'll get the credits UwU, so everybody wins.
